    >>> from london.utils.imports import import_anything
    >>> from london.urls import patterns
    >>> from london.test import assert_equal, assert_true
    >>> from london.test.client import Client
    >>> cl = Client()

ModelForm class for helping attachments on an object
----------------------------------------------------

    >>> from attachments.forms import AttachmentsModelForm

    >>> from london.apps.auth.models import User
    >>> class UserForm(AttachmentsModelForm):
    ...     class Meta:
    ...         model = User
    ...         fields = ('username','first_name')
    ...         template = 'attachments/tests/test_form.html'
    ... 
    ...     class Attachments:
    ...         engine = 'attachments.engines.FileSystem'
    ...         upload_to = 'attachments/user' # if relative, it goes into settings.UPLOADS_ROOT

    >>> urls = import_anything(cl.service.urls)
    >>> urls.url_patterns = patterns('',(r'^test-attachment-user/add/$',UserForm)) + urls.url_patterns

Using relative and string-typed upload_to

    >>> resp = cl.get('/test-attachment-user/add/')
    >>> assert_equal(resp.status_code, 200)

TODO

The attribute "upload_to" can also be an absolute path

    >>> UserForm.Attachments.upload_to = '/tmp/uploads/'

TODO

... it can be also a lambda

    >>> UserForm.Attachments.upload_to = lambda inst,filename: '/tmp/uploads/%s/%s' % (inst['pk'], filename)

TODO
